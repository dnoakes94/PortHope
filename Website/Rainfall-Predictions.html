				<h2>About this Project</h2>
				<p>
					For this solution, climate precipitation data was downloaded from Climate Data Canada for maximum 1-day total 
					precipitation amounts over a 100-year period starting in 2020 in a tiling format (Climate Data Canada 2020). 
				</p>
				<p>
					These were imported into ArcGIS Pro and a series of geoprocessing tools were run to put them into a readable 
					spatial format. Once the points were loaded from the tile layers, a kriging interpolation was run at 10-year intervals. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Once these raster surfaces were generated, they were compiled into a raster mosaic dataset. In order to host this unique 
					data set, they were uploaded to Fleming Collegeâ€™s Luna server to host the data and were then configured within the time-aware
					configurable web application through ArcGIS Online.
