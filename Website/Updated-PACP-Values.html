				<h2>About this Project</h2>
				<p>
					The municipality of Port Hope uses the Pipeline Assessment Certification Program (PACP) to assess pipe conditions. 
					PACP was developed by the National Association of Sewer Service Companies (NASSCO). The rating system includes three 
					categories: structural, maintenance, and overall pipe conditions. PACP values combined make up Quick Structural Scores (QSRs), 
					which are used to evaluate pipe segments for potential capital or maintenance projects. The quick scoring system consists 
					of 4-digit numbers based on the most severe and second most severe structural or maintenance defects in a pipe segment. 
					These scores are denoted as follows:
						QSR = WXYZ
						W = most severe pipe defect (between 0 & 5)
						X = number of defects in the most severe category 
						Y = second most severe pipe defect
						Z = the number of defects in the most severe category 
					For example, a pipe with a QSR value of 4213 would indicate that there are two defects that were rated a 5, and three defects 
					that were rated a 1. Table 1 provides an overview of the NASSCO rating criteria. 

					QSR ratings were provided by the municipality of Port Hopeâ€™s wastewater department. An existing shapefile of their pipe network 
					was edited to include the new QSR and PACP values using ArcGIS Pro. The updated shapefile was used to create static maps, as well as 
					web maps in ArcGIS Online.
