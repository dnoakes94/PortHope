                <p>
					Land use and ground permeability are important factors to consider when assessing rainfall derived inflow and infiltration. 
					This section looks at flood zones associated with a 90-minute, high intensity rainfall event (a cloudburst) and assesses which sections of 
					the pipe network intersect these flood zones. The slider allows a user to see at what point a flood area will become fully 
					saturated. The symbology for the pipe network shows areas that lay beneath these flood zones and are thus at risk of
					infiltration once a rainstorm event occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
					To understand how this process works an example is illustrated below:
					<br/> If a flood zones volume is 500 m3 and its watershed is 10,000 m2, the precipitation needed to fill the flood zone to its pour point 
					is 500 m3 / 10,000 m2 = 0.05 m = 50 mm.

				<h2>About this Project</h2>
				<p> 
				Due to significant variability of rainfall derived infiltration rates among different land usages a land 
				use classification of the municipality of Port Hope was undertaken. For example, highly developed areas 
				(ie. buildings, roads) are much more impervious than agricultural areas and will have significantly less 
				infiltration and higher runoff rates. The land use classification was done with the use of orthorectified 
				images and a supervised classification based on training sites. A total of 6 land use categories were created: 
				water, forest, agricultural, urban residential, urban development, and open grass. The resulting map can be seen 
				in the web application below. Each surface contains a land permeability rating.

					<h2>Additional Information</h2>
					<h3>Creating the Cloudburst Model</h3>
					<p>
						1.	Using the DEM layer provided in the supplied data package low lying areas less then .05m were filled to increase vertical 
						accuracy of the model.
						<br/>2.	After small sinks were filled the value of 1 was applied to the cells if the flood areas were considered a flood zone 
						all other data received a ‘No Data’ value. This helped set up the tool with the preliminary flood zones in place but without 
						any mathematical functions applied to them at this point.
						<br/>3.	Region Group tool was used to assemble all flood zones into a single layer
						<br/>4.	A Zonal statistics tool was then used to sum the elevation values and add them to a newly created field. A watershed was 
						created to derive the flood zones.
						<br/>5.	Next, the Get Raster Properties tool was used to get each cell value and then perform a calculate field function on the flood 
						zones to calculate the total volume of the flood area. It was then added to a new field in the attribute table.
						<br/>6.	The flood zones and the fill up field were combined to calculate the amount of rain (in millimeters) that must fall to fully 
						fill the flood zone to its pour point. This was calculated by a simple equation; (flood zone volume(m3) / watershed area(m2)) * 1000 = 
						Total Precipitation.
						<br/>7.	Finally, a Raster to polygon tool was used to convert the flood zones to individual polygons and then they were dissolved to 
						create individual flood zones that contained; fill up volume (in meters cubed), amount of rain to fill the flood spot in a 90 minute burst (in millimeters), and the total area of the flood zone (in meters squared).
