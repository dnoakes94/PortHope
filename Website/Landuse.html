                <p>
					Land use and ground permeability are important factors to consider when assessing rainfall derived inflow and infiltration. 
					This section looks at flood zones associated with a 90-minute, high intensity rainfall event (a cloudburst) and assesses which sections of 
					the pipe network intersect these flood zones. The slider allows a user to see at what point a flood area will become fully 
					saturated. The symbology for the pipe network shows areas that lay beneath these flood zones and are thus at risk of
					infiltration once a rainstorm event occurs.
                </p>
                <p>
					To understand how this process works an example is illustrated below:
					<br/> If a flood zones volume is 500 m3 and its watershed is 10,000 m2, the precipitation needed to fill the flood zone to its pour point 
					is 500 m3 / 10,000 m2 = 0.05 m = 50 mm.

				<h2>About this Project</h2>
				<p> 
				Due to significant variability of rainfall derived infiltration rates among different land usages a land 
				use classification of the municipality of Port Hope was undertaken. For example, highly developed areas 
				(ie. buildings, roads) are much more impervious than agricultural areas and will have significantly less 
				infiltration and higher runoff rates. The land use classification was done with the use of orthorectified 
				images and a supervised classification based on training sites. A total of 6 land use categories were created: 
				water, forest, agricultural, urban residential, urban development, and open grass. The resulting map can be seen 
				in the web application below. Each surface contains a land permeability rating.
