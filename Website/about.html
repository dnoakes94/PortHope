				<h2>Overall Purpose of the Project</h2>
				<p>
						Using a combination of ArcGIS desktop and ArcGIS web applications this project seeks to evaluate the climate 
						change impact of high intensity rainfall events on the wastewater network of Port Hope.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Brief Overview</h2>
				<p>
					Using hydrological calculations to estimate max capacity of each pipe network our team has focused on creating a tool that will 
					take user input for rainfall amounts and output areas along the network that are at risk of exceeding max capacity. 
					The project has also utilized PACP ratings collected by the city of Port Hope to visualize areas along the network 
					that are at risk of failure during a rainstorm event.  We have also focused on creating a time series map to help 
					the city of Port Hope visualize the increased intensity of rainfall events in the near future.
				</p>

				<h2>Objectives</h2>
				
				<ol type = "1">
				  	<li> Build a tool estimates pipe flow performance based on pipe flow capacity and rainfall events to produce a risk assessment map</li>
					<br></br>
					<li> Accurately map the lateral and conduit services and apply performance ratings to the existing dataset</li>
					<br></br>
					<li> Generate an interactive web application that models different precipitation events and identifies when certain thresholds of precipitation will impact sections of pipe exceeding design capacity</li>
					<br></br>
					<li> Develop a time series application that visualizes current and future rainfall events based on climate predictions </li>
					<br></br>
					<li>Create static maps displaying PACP values, flood zones, and major 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, and 100 year storm events </li>
				</ol>
