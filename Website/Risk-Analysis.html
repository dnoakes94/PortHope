				<h2>About this Project</h2>
				<p>
					The slider displayed in this web application was created with the use of ArcGIS Operations Dashboard. ArcGIS Pro
					was used for back end processing and data manipulation and python programming was used to create the desktop tool. 
				</p>
				<p>	 
					The process of accurately depicting areas at risk during a rainstorm event required several steps:
				</p>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Calculate the maximum volume of water that can travel through a pipe to establish a maximum capacity for each pipe. 
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>
							Calculate Dry Weather Flow (DWF) based on daily pipe usage. To find the DWF the number of parcels connecting to the pipe 
							network were calculated and then an average waterwater output per property type was assumed based on the land classification (i.e. residential or industrial).
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>
							Pipe roughness was calculated and applied to the final calculation to account for friction applied to the flow by a channel.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li> 
							Next, rainfall derived inflow and infiltration was calculated using an average inflow rate for urban residential areas in all calculations. 
							This was used to calculate flow during a rainstorm event. Ultimately, it was added to the DWF and if it surpassed max capacity a risk layer 
							would be displayed for those pipe segments.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>  
							A tool was created as a python script and performed all calculations backend and took a user input for rainfall amount that would alter the
							output of the pipe segments at risk.
						</li>
						<br/>
						<li>
							Another python script was developed which added all values to a single field in the attribute table of the conduits feature class. It
							displays the amount of rain that must fall in a single event to put each portion of pipe at risk.
						</li>

						<br/>
						<li>
							When creating the slider for the final web application output a query was used on data from the attribute table in the conduits feature class 
							to display areas at or below the amount being shown on the slider.
						</li>
					</ol>
